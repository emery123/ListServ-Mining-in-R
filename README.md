# ListServ-Mining-in-R
Create wordcloud from a listserv and find associated words

For this code to work, you must set up a folder with all the emails you want to analyze. I did this by downloading Thunderbird, parsing for just the emails from the listserv and downloading them all into a folder. They will come as .eml files which are coverted to a corpus.
